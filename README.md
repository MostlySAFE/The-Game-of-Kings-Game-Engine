# The Game of Kings Game Engine - Forge your Throne in the Public Domain. 
Remember when wargaming was "The Game of Kings" - a noble's secret for plotting sieges on sand tables and chessboards? 
From Prussian war colleges in 1811 to H. G. Wells' 'Little Wars' plea for peace through toy soldiers, these mechanics shaped empires. But today? Locked behind IP fortresses, C&D catapults, and trillion dollar conglomerates. 
Enter The Game of Kings Game Engine (TGoKGE); a battle-tested, irrevocably public domain framework that's your open-source war chest for crafting tabletop RPGs and wargames.
No licenses, no royalties, no dragons. Just pure, remixable power.

# Why TGoKGE? The Revolution in a Rulebook.
Public Domain Liberation: CC0-dedicated 2023 (v1.0), updated through 2025 (v1.3 stability tweaks).
216 System mechanics based on rolling 1d6 "To Hit", "Armor Save", & "To Wound", 1d12 break tests, spike probabilities, bound bonuses,, and Special Rules. Yours to copy, adapt, and build your own universe - even for commercial use.
Flavor? Bolt on your Lore based on Beowulf orcs, Norse jotnar, or cyber-zombies - all from our Appendix of PD roots.
No infringement fears. These are ideas unleashed, per the 1976 Copyright Act. 

# Proven Balance & Timeless Mechanics.
Compiled from Kriegspiel's umpires to Featherstone’s point systems, this engine nails tactical depth without bloat. Mini-agnostic (25mmm to 54mm, 3D Print friendly).
Core Loop: Move, Science, Shoot, Assault with 216 System resolution. Playtested for emergent chaos: hordes scatter when morale fails, heroes hold the band together.
Stable, scalable, and screams "fair fight" from skirmish to epic battles. 

# History as Your Ally.
Not just rules- a manifesto tracing Chaturanga dice to Moltke’s staff rides. Lawfare's rise (Chapterhouse victory to Ghamak’s 2025 stand), and retrocloning's renaissance. 
Wells dreamed of umpire-free games; we're making it real for creators dodging OGL's pitfalls and ORC's fine print. 
This is your neutral ground.

Grab your v1.3 LDF/source docs here. Fork on GitHub, jam on ich.io - prototype a Lich ambush or Jetan variant. 
Publishers: point-buy armies for commercial drops.
Hobbyists: kitbash with Reaper or PLA.
We're MostlySAFE LLC, but you're the Vanguard. As Tony Bath said, "Your tastes and fancies are the only rules."

# Download. Adapt. Rule.
May your tables echo with clashing minis and lasting legends.
Dedicated to the Beneficent. That which is good for the earth: remains.
